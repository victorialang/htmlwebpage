For my “project1”, I chose to create a ‘fan website for my favorite stuff.’ My family has always been Ohio State football fans, so I created an OSU fan football page. 

There are three basic pages which I will explain below:
- “index.html”
	- This is the main or homepage. On this page, there is a welcome center complete with an OSU background image. There is a weekly recap from rlevenwarriors.com with a link to that page.
	- Additionally there are links to the other two pages, player statistics and photo gallery.
	- Finally, There is a section to vote for the player of the week with a drop-down menu that allows the user to select one player. If the user would like to sign up for a mailing letter, they are able to input their email address in the blank and sign up. 
	- There are links to the top and middle of the page. 
	- The OSU fight song is looped playing in the background of the page.

- “stats.html”
	- This page has information on the football team and their statistics.
	- There is a table that provides the 2017 schedule complete with dates, air-times, and opponents.
	- There is a 2016 highlight video that plays without controls, on autoplay, and looped.
	- The 2016 statistics lists the teams that OSU both won and lost to.
	- There is a <dl> which outlines important football terminology.
	- There are 5 important players listed with their respective positions.
	- There is a section for “Important past players” which includes 2 iFrames linking to information on Ezekiel Elliot and Archie Griffin 
	- There are links to the home page and back to the top of the current page.

- “gallery.html”
	- The photo gallery page has pictures and gifs depicting the important traditions of OSU football such as the stadium and Script Ohio, all with captions beneath their respective images to explain the significance.
	- There are links to the home page and back to the top of the current page.
