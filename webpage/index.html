          Ohio State enters the off week coming off four-straight games where the offense scored over 50 points and five straight games where it put up over 500 total yards and 300 passing yards.
        </p>
        <p>
          J.T. Barrett, who was the recipient of a barrage of criticism just a few weeks ago from fans and media questioning if he should even be the starting quarterback, has a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 21-1, won too many national player of the week awards to count this week, and has the fourth-best odds to take home the Heisman Trophy in December.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's how you want your offense – and your quarterback – to be performing ahead of a do-or-die matchup against the nation's No. 2 team with Big Ten and national title hopes on the line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since the team's early loss to Oklahoma, the Buckeye offense has looked different; it's looked enhanced. But quarterbacks coach Ryan Day said at its core, the offense is not much different than it has been in the past – if you can think of a play, the Buckeyes have run it. The success, according to Day, is more a matter of knowing their weapons, and putting those players in positions to succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You look at the film, you have to look at it through the eyes of what your players can do, and make sure you’re picking the right thing," Day said. “There’s a million plays out there, we all can find the playbook. It’s just trying to find the right plays that fit who we are.”
